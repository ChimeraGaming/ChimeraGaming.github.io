# About Me

Hi, I’m ChimeraGaming.  

I graduated from **Full Sail University** with my **B.S. in Information Technology** and I’m always looking to expand my abilities.  
This site is proof of that journey.

## What I Do

### Console Modding
I run a small **mod shop out of my home**, where I offer:
- Console shell swaps  
- Assistance with game backup setup  
- Custom Firmware (CFW) installs  
- Micro soldering and advanced hardware mods  
- Mod chip install

## My Projects

### EZ-Flash Guide
When I first started with flashcarts, I realized that while information existed online, it was scattered and incomplete.  
Some answers were known in communities but never documented.  

So I spent **days piecing everything together**, and eventually built the **EZ-Flash Guide**.  
It may not be perfect, but it helps and that’s what matters most.

### Chromium Extensions
I also experiment with **HTML and Chromium-based extensions**.  
It started with a need for folders in **Stremio**, but friends learned about it and inspired new projects like a **translator** that converts **Link’s grunts into English**.  

That one was built in about **30 minutes**, but it shows how fun ideas can quickly become real tools.

## Looking Forward
I plan to **keep expanding my skills** and updating this site with new guides, tools, and personal projects.  

Feel free to reach out, send feedback, or support my small business. I’ll keep things as affordable as possible while delivering value to the community.
